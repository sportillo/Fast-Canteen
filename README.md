The aim of this project is to develop a system able to show the current occupancy status and expected wait time of a public canteen for college students.

The system utilizes a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to check the status of each seat of the canteen and propagate this information to a central server which collects and makes this information available to the user.

Moreover an additional subsystem is able to monitor the status of the queues, which is reported to the same server.

Through the use of specialized algorithms the system is able to predict the average wait time for each queue.
